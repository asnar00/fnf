# fnf

`fnf` stands for "feature normal form" : an experimental way of representing code written in any (or many) languages.

`fnf` is :

- *feature-modular* : code is organised as a tree of feature clauses, each of which adds detail to its parent. Feature clauses define and extend variables, types, and functions.

- *literate* : code is expressed as a human-readable markdown file (.fnf.md) with code snippets appearing within blocks of text.

- *contextual* : a feature source file contains contextual information such as specification, explanation, documentation, and tests, as well as the code.
